## Security Assessment

### Vulnerability Summary by Severity

#### ðŸ”´ Critical (2)
1. **No File Type Validation for Uploads**
   - Location: `/app/student/__init__.py` (lines 452-470)
   - No content validation for uploaded files
   - Malicious files (PHP, executables) can be uploaded

2. **XSS Vulnerability in nl2br Filter**
   - Location: `/app/__init__.py` (lines 104-112)
   - Use of `Markup()` introduces XSS risk

#### ðŸŸ  High (7)
1. **Weak Password Policy**
   - Minimum 8 characters, no complexity requirements
   - Vulnerable to brute force attacks

2. **User-Generated Content XSS Risk**
   - Multiple templates use `nl2br` filter
   - Stored XSS attacks possible

3. **Secret Key Management**
   - No validation when loading from environment
   - Weak keys compromise session security

4. **Uploaded Files in Static Directory**
   - Files in `static/uploads/` directly accessible
   - Could be executed if web server misconfigured

5. **OpenAI API Key Exposure Risk**
   - No API key validation
   - Could be exposed if misconfigured

6. **Debug Mode in Production Risk**
   - Debug mode can be enabled via environment
   - Stack traces and sensitive info exposed

7. **CSV Import Injection**
   - No sanitization of CSV data
   - Formula injection attacks possible

#### ðŸŸ¡ Medium (6)
1. **Password Reset Token Validity**
   - 1 hour is too long (recommend 15-30 minutes)

2. **No Session Timeout Configuration**
   - Sessions may persist indefinitely

3. **No API Rate Limiting**
   - API abuse, DoS attack risk

4. **CSRF Tokens Never Expire**
   - `WTF_CSRF_TIME_LIMIT = None`
   - Tokens can be reused indefinitely

5. **No Dependency Vulnerability Scanning**
   - Risk of known vulnerabilities in dependencies

6. **Weak Random Password Generation**
   - Uses Python's `random` module (not cryptographically secure)

#### ðŸŸ¢ Low (4)
1. **No Account Lockout**
   - Unlimited login attempts possible

2. **SQL Injection Protection** (Properly implemented)
   - SQLAlchemy ORM usage

3. **CSRF Protection** (Properly implemented)
   - Enabled with Flask-WTF

4. **Information Disclosure in Errors**
   - Error messages reveal system information

### Security Issue Details

#### 1. File Upload Security
```python
# Vulnerable code example
if 'image' in request.files:
    file = request.files['image']
    if file and file.filename != '':
        filename = secure_filename(file.filename)
        # No file type validation!
        file.save(filepath)
```

**Recommended Fix**:
- Validate file headers
- Restrict allowed extensions
- Validate file content
- Move upload directory outside web root

#### 2. XSS Protection
```python
# Current implementation (potential risk)
@app.template_filter('nl2br')
def nl2br(value):
    if not value:
        return value
    import markupsafe
    escaped = markupsafe.escape(value)
    return markupsafe.Markup(str(escaped).replace('\n', '<br>\n'))
```

**Recommended Fix**:
- Review all template usages
- Implement Content Security Policy (CSP)
- Ensure proper output encoding

#### 3. Authentication & Session Management
**Recommended Fix**:
- Strengthen password policy (12+ chars, upper/lower, numbers, special)
- Set session timeout (30 minutes)
- Implement account lockout after failed attempts
- Consider two-factor authentication
