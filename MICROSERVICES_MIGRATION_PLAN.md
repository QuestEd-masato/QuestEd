## Data Management Strategy

### Database Separation

#### Approach: Database-per-Service with Shared Reference Data
- Each service maintains its own database schema
- Shared reference data (like User IDs) replicated across services
- Event-driven synchronization for critical reference data updates

#### Service-Specific Databases:

1. **user_management_db**
   - Tables: users, schools, school_years, class_groups, student_enrollments

2. **academic_management_db**  
   - Tables: classes, class_student_relationships
   - References: user_id, school_id

3. **content_management_db**
   - Tables: curricula, main_themes, inquiry_themes, uploaded_files
   - References: class_id, user_id

4. **analytics_db**
   - Tables: activity_logs, goals, todos, milestones, student_evaluations
   - References: user_id, class_id

5. **assessment_db**
   - Tables: interest_surveys, personality_surveys, evaluation_records
   - References: user_id

6. **basebuilder_db**
   - Tables: problem_categories, basic_knowledge_items, text_sets, learning_paths, proficiency_records
   - References: user_id

### Data Consistency Patterns

#### Event Sourcing for Critical Operations
- User registration/modification events
- Enrollment changes
- Class assignments

#### Eventual Consistency for Analytics
- Activity logging can tolerate slight delays
- Performance metrics updated asynchronously

#### Strong Consistency for Authentication
- User authentication requires immediate consistency
- Role changes propagated synchronously

## Technical Implementation Details

### Containerization Strategy

#### Docker Configuration
Each service will be containerized with:

- Multi-stage builds for optimization
- Health check endpoints
- Resource limits and monitoring

#### Sample Dockerfile Template:
```dockerfile
FROM python:3.11-slim as base
WORKDIR /app
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

FROM base as production
COPY . .
EXPOSE 8000
HEALTHCHECK --interval=30s --timeout=3s --start-period=5s --retries=3 \
  CMD curl -f http://localhost:8000/health || exit 1
CMD ["gunicorn", "--bind", "0.0.0.0:8000", "app:create_app()"]
```

#### Message Queue Implementation
```python
# Example: User registration event
{
  "event_type": "user.registered",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  "user_id": "12345",
  "school_id": "67890",
  "role": "student",
  "metadata": {
    "source_service": "user-service",
    "version": "1.0"
  }
}
```

### Data Synchronization
